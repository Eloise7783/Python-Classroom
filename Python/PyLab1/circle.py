diameter = int(input("Enter diameter of this circle in cms: "))
radius = diameter / 2
pi = 3.14

area = pi * radius * radius
circumference = pi * diameter

print("the circumference of this circle is", circumference,"cm")
print("the area of this circle is", area,"cm2")

#pi r squared sounds like area to me, if I need the circumference I use pi d
